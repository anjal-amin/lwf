# Projects

## Intro: Building Tools for Better Experimenting
Creating tools that enable open-science and improve experimental workflows.

---

## 1. Spectrophotometer Data Logger
- Custom-built data logger for Shimadzu UV 1601 spectrophotometer:
  - Captures "% transmission" values for biomass.
  - Uploads data to a cloud database, plots in real time, and allows for direct analysis or publication-ready outputs.
  - Open-source and tailored to speed up experiments, especially where time-sensitive accuracy is critical.

## 2. Freezer Alarm System
- Alarm system for -80Â°C freezers:
  - Sends text or email alerts during temperature issues.
  - Operates during power outages or internet loss.
  - Open-source, adaptable, and no subscription fee, offering a cost-effective alternative to commercial solutions.

## 3. Six-Headed Peristaltic Pump
- Designed for biocement experiments as part of an NSF grant:
  - IoT-based control and monitoring.
  - Runs pumps independently or in complex patterns, including reverse flow.
  - Open-source and remotely accessible via browser or lab interface.
